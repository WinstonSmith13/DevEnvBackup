2. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf migration-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
   ```
3. Run the post-installation script:
   ```bash
   ./post_installation.sh
   ```
4. Install essential applications listed in `app_essentials.txt`
5. Clone your Git repositories using the information in `git-projects-info/git-repos.txt`

## Customization
